This is a Color Detection Block IP used to detect a single block of colour on the screen using HDMI input/output.

It has been designed for integration into a project for video streaming purposes.
The HDL files are provided instead of an IP repo and if anyone wants to use it
they simply have to import the HDL files while creating a brand new IP to wrap around this one.
Vivado has lots of cache files for IPs so it makes more sense to just have the HDL files which
anyone can import without Vivado fussing over them.
A testbench is provided to verify x-y tracking works for this IP.
